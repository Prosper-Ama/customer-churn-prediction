## Background
Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers, a significant challenge for businesses, particularly in the telecom industry. Understanding the factors that lead to churn can enable companies to implement effective retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle. It contains information about customers, including demographics, services used, and whether they have churned.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Implementing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the imbalanced distribution of the target variable.
4. **Model Selection**: Using various machine learning algorithms to predict churn.

## Implementation
- **Libraries Used**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
  
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Load the dataset.
  2. Perform EDA to understand the features and target distribution.
  3. Apply SMOTE to balance the classes in the dataset.
  4. Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn.

## Results
- After applying SMOTE, the models achieved improved performance metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of balancing techniques on model accuracy and precision.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of understanding customer churn and provides actionable insights for telecom companies to improve retention strategies.

## Future Work
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms.
- Implement more sophisticated feature engineering and selection methods.
